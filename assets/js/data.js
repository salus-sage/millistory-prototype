Hill, then Secretary of the Royal Society, that the Sir \nDorabji Tata Trust had agreed to sponsor his proposal for a fundamental \nresearch institute in physics. Hill replied with a prescient remark. “I \nthink you had better take biophysics under its wing, too,” he said. “I \nam sure many of the most important future applications of physics will \nbe in biology.”   </p>\n               \n              <p> The history of NCBS is tied to this broader quest for \nbuilding a name for biological research in India. The Identity theme has\n four chapters of stories that explore this: from the ways in which \npeople made the case for a separate space for biology, to weighing the \npros and cons of doing science in India. Identity is about building a \nrecognizable brand of research. And it is about contemplating on the \nscientific method itself – picking research questions and probing what \ndistinguishes biology. Reflections on science is a selection of comments\n from researchers at NCBS and beyond. </p>\n             \n           \n          "
